  <h2>About Me</h2>
  
<p>
  Results-driven software engineer with hands-on experience in real-time systems, autonomous flight control, and embedded software development. Proficient in C++, Python, PX4, and Raspberry Pi, with a strong background in developing telemetry systems, GPS modules, and flight controllers for UAVs.
</p>

<p>
  Currently leading the software team at BTU Alfa, where I manage the development of autonomous VTOL systems integrating GPS, telemetry, and advanced flight control features. I’ve increased system reliability through simulation-based testing on Linux and managed a team delivering real-time UAV solutions using PX4 and ArduPilot.
</p>

<p>
  Built a Python-based inventory automation tool during my time as an Engineering Lab Assistant with the ISKUR Youth Program, cutting manual tracking time by 80% and supporting technical infrastructure in university labs.
</p>

<p>
  I’m passionate about robotics, AI, and solving engineering problems that combine hardware and software in real-world applications. Based in Antalya, Turkey.
